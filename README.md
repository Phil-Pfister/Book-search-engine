## Description

---

This application is a book search engine that uses the google books API to allow the user to search their database for books. You can login to the app and save books that you may want to revisit, as well as delete them from your list. There are links to nav links to login/signup, search for books, and view your saved books. I was given a fully fuctioning app built with MERN stack and a RESTful API and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with the Apollo Server.
